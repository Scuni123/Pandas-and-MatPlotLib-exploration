# Pandas and MatPlotLib exploration
I spent a couple weeks exploring how to code in Python. I have never coded before and so I am going for a zero to hero moment. I don't expect myself to become a coding master, but I have a direction in mind that I would like to explore.

A few days ago, I just finished up my first Python project called Build A Graph. It just took user input and then created a graph using basic Python Sytax. While not a master, I felt like I had the basics done enough to move onto the next thing. After python basics, I wanted to understand Numpy, Pandas and MatplotLib as these are critical for data science. I was learning about these in parallel to the Python basics, so I felt ready to explore them on my own.

### This "project"
While I wouldn't necessarily call this a full on project, this was my first time importing data from a CSV I found, cleaning the data from missing data and unwanted data, then indexing and plotting various graphs for trends I wanted to see.

Nothing groundbreaking in this, but it helped me become more comfortable with pandas DataFrames as well as Jupyter Notebooks.
